# Etch-a-Sketch 🎨

A modern and colorful take on the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy — built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, but with my own personal twist and design enhancements.

## 🌟 Features

## 🌗 Theme Toggle Button (New)

A theme toggle button has been added to the site, allowing users to manually switch between **light** and **dark** mode.  
The site also respects the user's **system preferences** by default, but the toggle provides an option to override that setting in real time.

**Features:**
- Detects user's preferred color scheme (light or dark)
- Allows manual toggling between themes
- Smooth transition for a better user experience

> 💡 You can find the button at the top-right corner of the page (or wherever it is located in your layout)

- ## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation & event handling)
